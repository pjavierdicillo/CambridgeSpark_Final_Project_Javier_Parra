@Author: Javier Parra

The London Airbnb Data Analysis project aims to explore and derive insights from the London UK Airbnb Open Dataset. The dataset contains information about various listings, hosts, and reviews in London.

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

-Understand the distribution of listings across neighborhoods.
-Identify the most expensive and popular neighborhoods.
-Explore temporal patterns in the number of reviews and availability.
-Perform correlation analysis to uncover relationships between different features.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:

-Dropped irrelevant columns and handled missing values.
-Converted data types for better analysis.
-Handled outliers for selected numerical columns.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-Visualised distribution of listings across neighborhoods.
-Identified the most expensive and popular neighborhoods.
-Explored temporal patterns in reviews and availability.
-Conducted correlation analysis between key numerical features.
-Looked into statistics of continuous variables

Insights and Plots:

-Identified the most popular room type overall and per neighborhood.
-Explored the minimum nights required per room type.
-Analysed the most active neighborhood based on recent reviews.

Temporal Patterns:

-Utilised time series analysis to visualize the number of reviews over time.
-Examined monthly distribution of reviews and review frequency.
-Explored changes in average availability over time.

The analysis provided valuable insights into the London Airbnb market, including popular neighborhoods, pricing trends, and temporal patterns. 
Visualizations and statistical analyses aid in understanding the dataset's characteristics and relationships between different variables.
