The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

-Understand the distribution of listings across neighborhoods.
-Identify the most expensive and popular neighborhoods.
-Explore temporal patterns in the number of reviews and availability.
-Perform correlation analysis to uncover relationships between different features.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:

-Dropped irrelevant columns and handled missing values.
-Converted data types for better analysis.
-Handled outliers for selected numerical columns.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-Visualised distribution of listings across neighborhoods.
-Identified the most expensive and popular neighborhoods.
-Explored temporal patterns in reviews and availability.
-Conducted correlation analysis between key numerical features.
-Looked into statistics of continuous variables

Insights and Plots:

-Identified the most popular room type overall and per neighborhood.
